# OpenGL Rendering Engine 

An OpenGL rendering engine written in C++. 
The engine is small and light. 
It implements things like shadow mapping, ambient occlusion, and shader application.
This engine is made open source through the MPL 2.0 license.

- This is a software rasterizer for OpenGL
- This does not use any existing graphics libraries

This is a proof-of-concept _and_ a learning tool for myself.

Good game development necessitates a good understanding of graphics.
